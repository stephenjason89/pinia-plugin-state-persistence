# Features

## Key Features

- **Universal Storage Support**: Compatible with a wide range of storage mechanisms:

  - **Synchronous Storage**:
    - `localStorage`
    - `sessionStorage`
    - `cookies`
  - **Asynchronous Storage**:
    - `indexedDB` (via libraries like `localForage`)
    - `cloud-based storage solutions` (via custom implementations)
  - **Custom Storage**: Easily extend the plugin to work with any storage mechanism by implementing a `getItem`, `setItem`, and `removeItem` interface.

- **Customizable Persistence**:

  - Define custom key names for saved states.
  - Filter mutations to decide which should trigger persistence.
  - Use custom serialization/deserialization methods to fit your data handling needs.

- **Debugging Support**: Includes a built-in logger to track plugin operations and debug state persistence behavior.

- **State Overwriting**: Optionally overwrite the store state during initialization with persisted data, providing a seamless experience for users returning to the app.

- **SSR Compatibility**: Fully functional in server-side rendering environments, ensuring your app works seamlessly across client and server.

## Why Choose This Plugin?

- **Zero Dependencies**: Lightweight and relies solely on Pinia, with no external dependencies.
- **Compact Size**: Minified and gzipped size of only **1 kB**.
- **Queueing Mechanism**: Eliminates race condition issues when working with asynchronous storages.
- **Async Storage Support**: Includes `$onRestore()` method to easily wait for asynchronous storage restoration.
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Offers advanced configuration options for fine-tuning persistence behavior.
- **Developer-Centric**: Designed with real-world scenarios and use cases in mind.

<summary>To add custom storage (Click to expand)</summary>

Implement the following interface to use custom storage:

```typescript
interface Storage {
  getItem: (key: string) => string | Promise<string | null> | null;
  setItem: (key: string, value: string) => void | Promise<void>;
  removeItem: (key: string) => void | Promise<void>;
}
```
